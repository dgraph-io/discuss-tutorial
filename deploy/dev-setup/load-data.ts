const qsQuote = `
With Dgraph you design your application in GraphQL. 

You start by designing a set of GraphQL types that describes your app. When you load that data model into Dgraph, it takes those types, prepares graph storage for them and generates a GraphQL API with queries and mutations.

With that you can iterate quickly.  Thanks to Dgraph and all the tools in the GraphQL ecosystem, you can iterate on your data model and app without leaving your editor.  There's so many great tools in GraphQL to help you develop, you should set those up early so you get a great development experience.

With Dgraph, you design the graph of your, store a graph and query a graph. You think and design in terms of the graph that your app is based around.  And, best of all, you do all that inside the GraphQL ecosystem.
`

const docsQuote = `
Dgraph creates a GraphQL API from nothing more than GraphQL types. That's great, and gets you moving fast from an idea to a running app. However, at some point, as your app develops, you might want to customize the behaviour of your schema.

In Dgraph, you do that with code (in any language you like) that implements custom resolvers.

Dgraph doesn't execute your custom logic itself. It makes external HTTP requests. That means, you can deploy your custom logic into the same Kubernetes cluster as your Dgraph instance, deploy and call, for example, AWS Lambda functions, or even make calls to existing HTTP and GraphQL endpoints.
